<h2> Bucking the national trend </h2>
      <p>Despite national statistics suggesting UK pubs are on the decline, Sheffield is continuing to thrive as the so-called Capital of Beer.

<p>The number of pubs within the UK has declined from 75,000 to 40,000 according to CAMRA statistics released last year.

<p>What’s more this decline is getting worse because of the increase in beer duty since the last Budget. This means beer duty is rising by 2p.

  <h2> Micro pubs</h2>

<p>  Sheffield is breaking the trend however by maintaining its active brewing industry, and ensuring it offers affordable beverages to members of the public.

  <p>Micropubs are revolutionising Sheffield’s beer reputation by offering customers unique, local brews, in a small, intimate setting.

<p>  The Iberico café in Sheffield, Crookes Road, is going to be transformed into a micro pub, selling local craft beer. Even though it received good reviews as a cafe, the owners are deciding to join the beer industry.

<p>  Unlike traditional pubs, the micro pub will not be selling your typical range of mainstream lagers such as Carling, Guinness, Carlsberg or Fosters. Instead it will be serving local beer brewed in the city and its surrounding areas. </p>

        <p>The Portland House on Ecclesall Road is an example of a micropub which is proving to be a hit with locals, serving ales from the Welbeck Abbey brewery in Worksop.

    <p> As well as beer however, the site also serves wine after they teamed up with Le Bon Vin, a Sheffield wine merchant business run by a family.

    <p> Local products are very much the order of the day.

    <p> Another micropub/bar making a name for itself is Public, located beneath the town hall, with a capacity of approximately 20 people. The building has been converted from a public gentleman’s toilet, an example of innovation in the city.

    </p>‘‘Sheffield still has more independent makers than anywhere else,’’ said John Hamshere, Chief Executive of Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust.</P>

<h2> The beer capital </h2>
  <p> Sheffield has been recognised as something of a beer capital, with the city’s brewing history stretching as far back as 1758.
  <p>Pete Brown, a national beer expert, said Sheffield is ‘‘a significant brewing city’’ with nearly five times more breweries than London per capita.

  <p>Thornbridge Brewery, based in nearby Bakewell, for example has gone national, as local breweries begin to extend their products beyond South Yorkshire.

  <p>Partnered with Craft Beer Residency, Thornbridge is selling its beer to more than 100 bars throughout the country.

  <p>Simon Webster, CEO of Thornbridge Brewery, said: ‘‘We have a real passion for pubs and want to introduce our beers to a wider market.

  <p>‘‘This gives us the opportunity to work towards ensuring our beer is present in every corner of the country!’’

  <div>
  <p>Bradfield Brewery is based in a village just outside Sheffield, unsurprisingly called Bradfield. Come Christmas they produce a special beer called Belgian Blue. It's
    purple in hue, and is always served with a frothy head. The beer is flavoured and coloured with blueberries, and for many Sheffield locals is the only pint that will do
    in the festive season.  </p>

  <p> Ever tried a mint chocolate stout? Me neither. Thornbridge Brewery are based in the Peak District and and have been tantalising tastebuds with their fun flavours since 2005. </p>

  <p>Sheffield Brewing Co are based in an old Victorian factory which was famous for producing Blanco Polish. Fittingly, this chocolate orange number is named after a polish which was
    produced there back in the day. With a zesty and chocolately taste it is perfect for the cold winter months in the Steel City.

  <div>
  <p>From Sentinel Brewing Company, a beer that is flavoured with Rosehip and Rhubarb, inspirationally called RRG. In the style of a Gose beer, which is traditionally salty, sour but refreshing, this brew will certainly spring a surprise on your unexpecting taste buds. </p>
